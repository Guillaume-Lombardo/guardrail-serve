# guardrail-serve

Native Go service for serving LLM guardrails.

The public HTTP contract is exposed through `huma`, so the registered Go request/response types are the source of truth for the generated OpenAPI document and Swagger UI.

## Status

This repository is migrating from the archived Python reference implementation in `archive/bdf-guardrails` to a native Go implementation focused on lower latency, smaller images, and clearer operational boundaries.

`archive/` is reference material only and must never be committed as part of active delivery work.

## Current Target

The first Go implementation serves deterministic guardrails on:

- `/scan/secrets`
- `/scan/pii`
- `/scan/prompt-injection`
- `/beta/litellm_basic_guardrail_api`
- `/docs`
- `/openapi.json`
- `/openapi.yaml`

The decision contract is:

- `NONE`
- `BLOCKED`
- `GUARDRAIL_INTERVENED`

HTTP errors are returned as JSON with a `detail` field.
Guardrail execution failures are returned as HTTP `502` with the stable JSON detail `Guardrail execution failed.`.

Interactive Swagger UI is served on `/docs`.
Generated OpenAPI is served on `/openapi.json` and `/openapi.yaml`.
When `API_PREFIX` is configured, these routes are served under the same prefix.

Payload guardrail limits are configured through `MAX_TEXT_ITEMS` and `MAX_TEXT_CHARS`. Non-positive or invalid values fall back to the documented defaults.

Current request validation is text-first: each scan request must include at least one `texts` entry, and non-empty `images`, `tools`, `tool_calls`, `structured_messages`, and `request_data` fields are rejected until those inputs are supported explicitly.

Each request returns an `X-Request-ID` header. If the client provides `X-Request-ID`, the service reuses it for request correlation.

## Logging

Logging uses the Go stdlib `log/slog` stack.

- `LOG_FORMAT=human` emits readable text logs for local development and operator inspection
- `LOG_FORMAT=json` emits structured JSON logs for export pipelines and machine processing

Request logs include contextual fields such as request id, method, path, guardrail, input type, decision, status code, and duration.

## Development Workflow

```bash
gofmt -w .
go test ./...
go test ./tests/integration/...
go test ./tests/end2end/...
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Project Layout

- `cmd/guardrail-serve`: application entrypoint
- `internal/app`: application wiring and HTTP server bootstrap
- `internal/domain`: guardrail contracts and core behaviors
- `internal/guardrails`: built-in guardrail implementations
- `internal/httpapi`: HTTP handlers, routes, request/response schemas
- `internal/config`: environment and runtime configuration
- `internal/resources`: embedded YAML rule sets and loading helpers
- `tests`: unit, integration, and end-to-end coverage
- `docs`: engineering guides and ADR records (`docs/README.md`)
- `skills`: AI helper skills for coding workflows
- `agent.md`: AI agent role, principles, and delivery contract
- `AGENTS.md`: operational guardrails and pre-PR checklist
- `plan.md`: collaborative planning workspace
- `SKILLS.md`: index of local skills and when to apply them

## GitHub Bootstrap

1. Initialize local git history.
2. Create or connect the GitHub repository.
3. Push the initial `main` branch.
4. After bootstrap, do all further work on dedicated branches with PRs, CI, and review.
